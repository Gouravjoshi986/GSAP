* two basic methods are to and from 
1. using to 
gsap.to({key value pair})

* When you are moving element from initial position to final position we use gsap.to 
* when we are moving element from final position to initial position we use gsap.from 
// You can also use css properties in this gsap methods (* write in camel case)

* When working with multiple elements we use stagger to make sure everyone works one by one.  ( each element will run one by one and will take time you mentioned in stagger)
