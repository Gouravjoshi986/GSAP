// imported using gsap cdn link 

* two basic methods are to and from 
1. using to 
gsap.to({key value pair})
eg.  gsap.to("css selector",{ // properties object})

* When you are moving element from initial position to final position we use gsap.to 
* when we are moving element from final position to initial position we use gsap.from 
// You can also use css properties in this gsap methods (* write in camel case)

* When working with multiple elements we use stagger to make sure everyone works one by one.  ( each element will run one by one and will take time you mentioned in stagger)
// for repeat we can use repeat property and give it value for no. of repetitions
// Repeat = -1 is for infinite 

* Property for going from initial to final state and coming back from final to initial state is called yoyo. 
// This yoyo property could be set to true or false.

// GSAP Timelines 
// When we want to run animation in a sequentital manner we use timelines as it would be a big hassle to calculate all the delays and hardcode them in our code. 
// var tl = gsap.timeline()
// this tl object is now a timeline object and the objects written using tl.to or from will now run in sync and you dont need to hand out delays now.
