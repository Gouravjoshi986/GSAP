// imported using gsap cdn link 

* two basic methods are to and from 
1. using to 
gsap.to({key value pair})
eg.  gsap.to("css selector",{ // properties object})

* When you are moving element from initial position to final position we use gsap.to 
* when we are moving element from final position to initial position we use gsap.from 
// You can also use css properties in this gsap methods (* write in camel case)

* When working with multiple elements we use stagger to make sure everyone works one by one.  ( each element will run one by one and will take time you mentioned in stagger)
// for repeat we can use repeat property and give it value for no. of repetitions
// Repeat = -1 is for infinite 

* Property for going from initial to final state and coming back from final to initial state is called yoyo. 
// This yoyo property could be set to true or false.

// GSAP Timelines 
// When we want to run animation in a sequentital manner we use timelines as it would be a big hassle to calculate all the delays and hardcode them in our code. 
// var tl = gsap.timeline()
// this tl object is now a timeline object and the objects written using tl.to or from will now run in sync and you dont need to hand out delays now. 


* Scroll Trigger = keeps track of users scrolling and triggers animations based on users scroll 
-- plugin of gsap 
it can be directly used while writing properties object * scrollTrigger:"selector name"
* or we can use scrollTrigger:{
    trigger:"selector name",
    scroller:"body",
    marker:true/false,
    start:"top 60% etc."
    end:"some value"     
}
// these are scroll trigger properties and can be used to have more control 
* to make the animation completely dependent on scrolling we can use property:
* scrub: true or value between 1 to 5
higher the value more the smoothness.
// whenever a pin property is used in scroll trigger the trigger must be the parent element.  and the element will stop and wont move till we move back. 

// SVG = scalable vector graphics (pixels dont distort in these images)
// it is a container (svg path curve).  we can change the d/path of svg to modify it. 

Gsap easing is used to control graph/curve speeds.
svgs can be modified by dom manipulation eg.in svg folder. 

// look at code of other use cases 

// to provide delay during a timeline use -=1 or +=1 after property object 
eg .  to.from("",{
    properties
},"-=1"/"name")          --> starts this animation one sec earlier 
* if you pass a random string to two differant objects then they will run together  
  - classes with "name" will run together in timeline. 

// you can pass scroll trigger in timeline object to trigger a timeline. 
eg  var tl = gsap.timeline({
    scrollTrigger:{
        properties. 
    }
})

// *  Standard gsap was not compatible with react so a new hook was created which can be found on gsap react docs   hook =  useGSAP()
